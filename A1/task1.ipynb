# Matched Columns:
#'category': Essential for classifying and sorting products by category.
#'name': Serves to identify individual products.
#'current_price': Provides a glimpse into pricing tactics.
#'likes_count': Shows customer interest and product popularity.
#'discount': Indicates the attractiveness of the pricing.
#'is_new': Highlights the novelty of the product, which can impact customer appeal.

# Removed Columns:
#Columns not included in the selected list were omitted as they didn't directly aid in identifying top products or evaluating category performance.
#Columns like URLs, images, etc were excluded since they don't offer valuable insights for this analysis.
