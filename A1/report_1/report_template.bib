abstract = {This text presents an overview of the full range of logistic models, including binary, proportional, ordered, and categorical response regression procedures. It illustrates how to apply the models to medical, health, environmental/ecological, physical, and social science data. Stata is used to develop, evaluate, and display most models while R code is given at the end of most chapters. The author examines the theoretical foundation of the models and describes how each type of model is established, interpreted, and evaluated as to its goodness of fit. Example data sets are available online in various formats and a solutions manual is available upon qualifying course adoption.},

Abstract = {Remarkable advances in computation and data storage and the ready availability of huge data sets have been the keys to the growth of the new disciplines of data mining and machine learning, while the enormous success of the Human Genome Project has opened up the field of bioinformatics. These exciting developments, which led to the introduction of many innovative statistical tools for high-dimensional data analysis, are described here in detail. The author takes a broad perspective; for the first time in a book on multivariate analysis, nonlinear methods are discussed in detail as well as linear methods. Techniques covered range from traditional multivariate methods, such as multiple regression, principal components, canonical variates, linear discriminant analysis, factor analysis, clustering, multidimensional scaling, and correspondence analysis, to the newer methods of density estimation, projection pursuit, neural networks, multivariate reduced-rank regression, nonlinear manifold },
